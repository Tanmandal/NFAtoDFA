# NFAtoDFA
*Non-Deterministic to Deterministic Finite Automata Converter*

It is a hobby project that I developed with one of my friends while studing AFL in BTech 2nd Year.

This project has two flavours:
* Full Version : Needs no Dependencies
* light Version : Needs a Modern Web Browser to be present 

This project converts a Non-Deterministic Finite Automata to Deterministic Finite Automata and also gives option to view the final DFA Diagram.

**Installation :**

It is a portable application , requiring no installation. Just download the NFAtoDFA.zip or NFAtoDFAx.zip from resources as per requirement. Extract the zip files and run the corresponding exe files inside them.
